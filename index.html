            Hi! My name is Evan Keith, but I go by the name Fish Slappa across my different creative projects. 
            I'm a musician and writer, as well as a student of linguistics. Most of what you'll find here is 
            in some way related to either music or linguistics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the musical side, you'll find links to past
            performances I've done and music I've made, as well as hopefully some more conceptual musico-technological
            works and audio software in the future. Most of the music I make is strictly electronic, and grounded in DIY
            and open-source techniques.
        </p>
        <p>

            On the linguistics side, I'll post links to articles and research pieces I've written, as well as translations
            of existing works by other authors. I am particularly interested in historical linguistics and dialect studies
            related to the Austronesian language family, and much of what I write and translate relates to languages within
            this family, in particular Indonesian and Javanese.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is intended as a sort of CV, collating the projects I've done in a number of different fields in
            one place for anyone interested to see.
        </p>
