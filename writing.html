                <i>Nuanced Garbling</i> is a student journal published annually by the Melbourne University Linguistics Society, a student club which I have been involved with since 2019.
                The journal is unofficial and is not indexed or peer-reviewed, but articles go through an editing process by student volunteers.

            <h4><i>Jalan Raya Pos</i> (Great Post Road) - English Translated Subtitles</h4>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKwcfExdCx0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>
                <i>Jalan Raya Pos</i>, or <i>The Great Post Road</i>, is an Indonesian documentary film featuring author and essayist Pramoedya Ananta Toer. It recounts the history of the construction
                of the titular road across the island of Java by the Dutch colonial government. Much of the script is taken from an earlier essay by Pramoedya, of the same name. The film was originally released
                in Indonesian with Dutch subtitles. I have uploaded the film in full with English subtitles, as I do not believe any others exist. The subtitles are based on my own transcription and translation of the dialogue,
                so some inaccuracies may have occurred.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Tuyul dan Mbak Yul</i> (The Goblin and Ms. Yul) - English Translated Subtitles</h4>
            <p>
                <i>Tuyul dan Mbak Yul</i> is an Indonesian sitcom, or <i>Sinetron</i>, that came out in 2000. It follows the adventures of two <i>Tuyul</i>s, or goblins, as they
                interact with humans and try to avoid capture by goblin mercenaries. I have subtitled the first few episodes, and tend to release another one gradually from time to time.
                All the episodes for which I have made subtitles can be viewed below.
